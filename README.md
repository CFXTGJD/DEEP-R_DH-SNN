# DEEP-R_DH-SNN
The running instructions are in the run.sh file in each folder.\\
The basic functionalities of **DH-SNN** is based on the paper: **Temporal dendritic heterogeneity incorporated with spiking neural networks for learning multi-timescale dynamics**\\
The **DEEP R** algorithm is base on the paper: **DEEP REWIRING: TRAINING VERY SPARSE DEEP NETWORKS**
